      <h2 class="main-heading">What is Omakase?</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Unlike any of the offerings in our main menu, omakase is a traditional
        Inazuman dining style in which the chef provides a meal tailored to the
        diner's preferences based on the diner's availability, budget, taste,
        and seasonality. Similar to a tasting menu, Uyuu has served everyone
        from the Raiden Shogun and elite members of the Tenryou Commission with
        their massive dining budget, to other diners looking for a seasonal, but
        affordable specialized meal.
        <br />
        Omakase usually suggests that nigirisushi is one of, if not the only,
        components of the menu, and while our customers do usually get plenty of
        individual nigiri plates, we've also served artfully presented salads to
        highlight an astrologist's emphasis of enjoying a simple dish that fills
        them up while working on a column. Omakase can even boil down to
        delivering the best kinds of tea that Narukami Island can offer, as per
        one request that a certain consultant specified during their meal at
        Uyuu Restaraunt.
        <br />
        Expect that our omakase offerings mostly involve nigirisushi, makisushi,
        and other traditional sushi rolls, but know that we can also offer other
        seafood, meat, or vegetable dishes we are confident to put our branding
        into. That said, we sadly do not offer vegan omakase menus at this time.
        However, vegetarian omakase menus can be requested in your online
        reservation.
