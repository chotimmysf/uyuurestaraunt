      Ebi Tempura with Special Decorations from Kamisato Ayato, Head of the Kamisato Estate and Yashiro Commission
    </h4>
    <img
      src="/img/people/ayato_face.png"
      alt="Kamisato Ayato, Yashiro Commissioner"
    />
    <p class="description">
        The arrangement is exquisite and elegant, much like the manner in which Ayato handles all his affairs. 
        Any more, and it would have been excessive. Any less, and it would have proved a sight squandered.
        As you reach your chopsticks for that crystalline camellia, Ayato stops you... 
        "That was something I made during sword practice. It's just a decoration."

        Miso Soup with Special Touches from Thoma, Housekeeper of the Kamisato

        alt="Thoma, Housekeeper of the Kamisato Clan"

      <p class="description">
        The intricate appearance of this dish belies the simple ingredients
        used. But take a sip, and Thoma's sunshine smile comes straight to mind.
        Perhaps this is his special ability: warming the hearts of others using
        the simplest of ingredients.

      <p class="availability">
        The modified version with tofu instead of egg is available on the Main
        Menu as "Sangonomiya Fish Tail Inari". The original egg version is available on
        the Watatsumi Island Set Menu.
        You may substitute for the egg version of this dish outside of the set menu at no extra charge.
        Just specify the change on the notes of your online order or tell the server when they take
        your table's order.
      </p>
      <h4 class="special-blurb">
        Inari presented like Chakinzushi. Instead of using egg sheets, we use
        fried tofu to encase the sushi. Decorations are inspired by
      </br> Sangonomiya Kokomi, the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island

      <p class="description">
        The tofu is wrapped up almost like a package, and the fish tail at the
        end is both small and very cute. It really makes you wonder what's
        inside the package, but at the same time, you can't bear to eat such a
        beautiful-looking thing... You glance at the crystal-clear smile in
        Kokomi's eyes. Ah, darn it, you've fallen for her trick, haven't you?

  <p class="description">
      Made from fish that have been dried on the ship. Kazuha claims that they were completely ordinary fish.
    </br>But this flavor... this must surely be the definition of free, all-embracing nature, no?

    The fried tofu in here is specially made by the solemn Lady Kitsune. It is said that if you
    eat it all at one go with sincerity in your heart, you will have the protection of the Great
    Kitsune -- misfortune shall flee and fortune abound!

<p class="description">
  The side dishes have been piled high to form a sight as moving as Gorou's own motivations. As you finish the noodles and soup all in
  one go and pat your stomach in satisfication, you look up and see Gorou... smiling radiantly as his tail wags from side to side
  (the latter probably unbeknownst to him!)

  <h4 class="special-blurb">
    A special Yakult, Sprite, and Ube Creme drink featured in the famous light novel "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"
  </h4>
  <p class="description">
    Having featured in the famous light novel "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?", it has since been brought to life by Sailing 
    Breeze in collaboration with Yae Publishing House, along with its fascinating flavour. As this version does not contain 
    any bean products, it is slightly different from the special limited edition that was available during the Irodori Festival, 
    but this also means that there is no risk of triggering any bean allergies.

  <p class="description">
     This is almost like a small, lovely, and intricate artwork, with its pale red outer coat covering the feelings that the young maiden began to harbor
     from that moment on. If one had the honor to enjoy such a treat while having tea with a princess as graceful and noble as a white heron, one would
     surely yearn to have that moment stretch into eternity.

<p class="description">
    Watching the fireworks, your hands full of the snacks Yoimiya's given you, her carefree, child-like laughter in your ear as the pyrotechnic
     burst overhead... Amid this unique symphony of sounds, the plump goldfish in your hand almost looks like it might start swimming at any moment...
