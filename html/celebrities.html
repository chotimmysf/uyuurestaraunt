        Hmm? I remember this place being quite pleasant when I came here with
        the Traveler. Ah, the luxurious sashimi and grilled fish makes me
        imagine the fond memories I had of my master before she unexpectedly
        left. If you'd like to take me to Uyuu Restaraunt, bring me a plate of
        their finest grilled mackarel for no charge, would you?

        I heard of Uyuu Restaraunt through Miko - she told me that there was
        another place to enjoy desserts besides that one stall in Inazuma City.
        Whenever I'm not doing important duties as Shogunate, I'd see myself
        coming here alone specifically for the Dango Milk and Tricolor Dango. It
        has always been a hit every time I've been at Uyuu.

        I came here with the Traveler during the Irodori Festival, and the
        dishes at this restaraunt has left me with pleasant stories to write
        about. If you consider coming here, the Crab Roe Kourayaki, Tri-Flavored
        Skewer, and the quintessential Berry Mizu Manjuu will provide your soul
        with the optimal satisfication that Uyuu Restaraunt promises to serve.
        The Mondstadt Special Mushroom Pizza is different from the pizza I
        normally encounter back in Mondstadt, but I can clearly taste the
        distinct flairs that the Inazumans incorporated into their special pizza
        recipe that makes the dish unlike anything you can find in Mondstadt.

        I came here with Mr. Calx during a book signing for the Yae Publishing
        House, and while my arms felt tired from signing so much books, the Egg
        Rolls and Radish and Fish Stew provided much needed comfort for my
        hungry body and mind.

        While there are many extravagant dishes that Uyuu Restaraunt offers,
        such as the dedacant Butter Crab and cutely presented Invigorating Kitty
        Meal, I have frankly appreciated the simpler dishes like the Onigiri and
        Soba Noodles better. I find that the simplicity of these dishes
        highlight a brighter part of Inazuman cuisine. That being said, I did
        appreciate the Nigiri quite fondly. Who knew that such a simple concept
        could be executed so perfectly, with service similar to those given in
        the Yanshang Teahouse? I may have to host some of my business meetings
        at Uyuu from now on.

        Ever since the Shogun opened up Inazuma, I came back to remember the
        memories of walking down the streets of Inazuma City, remembering the
        transfer of commodities between the merchants of local Inazumans. That
        being said, the Dango Milk and Warmth brings back the memories I had
        with the friends I had in Inazuma, before the Vision Hunt Decree began.
        Oddly enough, I could say that these 2 dishes tasted the same as I
        remember, unlike a certain drink I had a long while ago. Perhaps those
        who shared the memories I had when I had my first sip of Dango Milk and
        first tounge burn from the miso soup are still there...?
