      <h2 class="main-heading">Operations</h2>
      <h3 class="question">When is Uyuu Restaraunt open?</h3>
      <p class="answer">

      </p>
      <h3 class="question">What is your policy on parties of 6 or more?</h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Uyuu Restaraunt will charge an automatic 12% gratiuty fee to all tables
        of 6 or more. Parties of 6 and more are highly suggested to reserve a
        time through
        <a href="/html/reservations.html">our Reservations page</a> or through
        our <a href="yelp.com">Yelp page</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">Are there any private dining options?</h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Uyuu Restaraunt does have a few private rooms that can host up to a
        maximum of 12 people each. For these reservations, please note that you
        would like a private room and we will accept by a case-by-case
        condition.
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        How is an Omakase reservation different from the typical reservation?
      </h3>
      <p class="answer">
        Omakase is specifically tailored for only 10 people at a time, and
        cannot be reserved through a typical reservation. In order to enjoy our
        omakase, you will need to reserve a time slot specifically on our
        <a href="/html/omakase.html">Omakase page</a>
        as we use a separate dining spot from the main menu for our omakase
        offerings.
